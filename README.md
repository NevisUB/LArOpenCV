# LArOpenCV

- To get started...

1. Look at setup_laropencv.sh (or source it if you trust it).
2. Need to compile UserDev/BasicTool before compiling LArOpenCV
3. "make -j" @ base dir LArOpenCV
4. To get started quickly, you may want to try:

```
> python App/mac/run_imagecluster_hit.py App/mac/Test.fcl [LARLITE_FILE1,LARLITE_FILE2,...]
```

- Look at Test.fcl to get confused (i.e. to get started)
