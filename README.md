# LArOpenCV

Someone update this README!

- To get started...

0. Look at setup_laropencv.sh (or source it if you trust it).
1. Need to compile UserDev/BasicTool before compiling LArOpenCV
2. "make -j" @ base dir LArOpenCV
3. To get started quickly, you may want to try:
```
  > python App/mac/run_imagecluster_hit.py App/mac/Test.fcl [LARLITE_FILE1,LARLITE_FILE2,...]
```
4. Look at Test.fcl to get confused (i.e. to get started)
5. Join Skype thread (ping kazu/Ariana/Vic/WHOEVER_ON_THREAD_ADD_YOUR_NAME)
